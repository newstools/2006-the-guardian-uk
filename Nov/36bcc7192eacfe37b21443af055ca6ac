A row has broken out between the Barmy Army and the Australian cricket board after the Army's trumpeter, Bill Cooper, who plays for the London Philharmonic Orchestra, was escorted from The Gabba on Thursday after celebrating the fall of Australia's third wicket. "We're not going to go home, but we're not happy about the way we've been treated," said Dave Peacock, one of the Army's founders. "We have always been self-policing and love coming to Australia. But when the trumpeter was asked to leave we were staggered." Peacock said negotiations were under way to allow the trumpeter back in. He said Cooper's musical interludes had been cleared with Cricket Australia in May, despite a statement by a CA official that "musical instruments have been banned from The Gabba for the last 12 years". "You can rest assured we'll get together on the hill at Adelaide for the second Test. Cricket Australia aren't going to stop us having fun," said Peacock. The Army also argues that visiting fans have been spread around the ground to dilute their voice. The Barmy Army was born in the 1994-95 Ashes series in Australia when local journalists decided fans following a losing team deserved a name. Four years ago they were castigated by the Australia batsman Justin Langer for shouting "no-ball" at Brett Lee. About 1,500 Army followers are expected for the fourth and fifth Tests in Melbourne and Sydney, swelling English support to about 10,000.
